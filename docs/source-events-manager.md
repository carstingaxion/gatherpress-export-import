# Events Manager — Source Details

Adapter class: `Events_Manager_Adapter`

---

## Post Type Mapping

| Source | Target |
|---|---|
| `event` | `gatherpress_event` |
| `location` | `gatherpress_venue` |

## Date Format

`Y-m-d H:i:s` stored in `_event_start` / `_event_end` with timezone in `_event_timezone`.

## Venue Handling

Events Manager stores venues as a dedicated custom post type (`location`). During import, location posts are rewritten to `gatherpress_venue`.

**Venue details** (`_location_address`, `_location_town`, `_location_state`, `_location_postcode`, `_location_country`) are automatically assembled into GatherPress's `gatherpress_venue_information` JSON format during import via the shared `Venue_Detail_Handler` trait.

Events reference their venue via `_location_id` post meta, which contains the original `location` post ID. During import, this ID is resolved via the WordPress Importer's old-to-new ID mapping and linked via `link_venue()`.

## Taxonomy Mapping

| Source Taxonomy | Target Taxonomy |
|---|---|
| `event-categories` | `gatherpress_topic` |
| `event-tags` | `post_tag` |

## Import Sequence

1. Export and import **locations first** (`location`).
2. Export and import **events** (`event`).
3. Flush permalinks.

## Playground Blueprint

## Known Limitations

- Shares the `event` post type slug with Event Organiser. Import data from only one source at a time.
- The adapter differentiates from Event Organiser by detecting `_event_start` in the meta keys.
- Venue phone and website are not stored as standard location meta and will be empty after import.
