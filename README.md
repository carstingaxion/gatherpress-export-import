üêõ While this works fine locally with the [default wordpress-importer](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-importer), but unfortunately [WordPress playground uses the wordpress-importer v2](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/1358), [which doesn't have our relevant hook anymore](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer/issues/93).
